# model-free-vs-model--based-learning
It is a training project that we did in summer school at Neuromatch Academy. We tried to test model-free vs. model-based learning theories for decision-making in mice using performing a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task using the Steinmetz dataset.
# Limits, Perspectives:
* Further consecutive sessions are required to confirm correlations
* Additional analysis :

  1- Behavioural data : 
  
          How does decision-making latency differs with probability of stimulus presentation on the left and  stimulus contrast
          
          Reinforcement learning/Bayesian model
          
  2- Neural data:
  
          Can specific neural pattern predict behavior? How does it change over time?
